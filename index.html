              Hello, there fellow stranger! My name is Uroš and I'm a web dev. Since I was a little kid I was
              always tinkering with computers, they were always my passion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember, that there was no better feeling for me than being able to help my friends, family
              members or anyone else with a problem that is related to technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm inspired with web development, learning new skills and problem solving. I'm always
              looking forward to new challenges to push myself.
            </p>
